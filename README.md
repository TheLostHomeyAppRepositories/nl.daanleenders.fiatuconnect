## Acknowledgements

Build from the base create new homey app of the [homey cli](https://github.com/athombv/node-homey).

Thanks to [wubbl0rz](https://github.com/wubbl0rz)'s (and fellow contributors) work on 
[FiatChamp](https://github.com/wubbl0rz/FiatChamp) which mapped the possibilities of the FIAT UConnect API. 
And [schmidmuc](https://github.com/schmidmuc)'s work on creating a PHP version to talk to the API with 
([schmidmuc/fiat_vehicle](https://github.com/schmidmuc/fiat_vehicle)), which is a language I am more familiar
with than the C# used in FiatChamp. Which I then used shamelessly to  build my own version of their project
but for Homey instead.
